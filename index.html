                <h2>my ventures</h2>
                <p>Since leaving sixth form, it has been a wild journey. I've gone from knowing nothing to learning how to teach myself things that take students years to learn. I've managed to do this because I've simply had to. I've had pressure from clients and my core principle of providing a service I would personally want to receive. </p>

                <h4><a href="http://rentseo.co.uk/" target="_blank">Meet RENTSEO.co.uk</a></h4>
                <p>RentSEO was one of my all time favorite's. It allowed me to offer a low cost, high valued service which allowed me to stay in touch with my clients and develop and scale up with their business.</p>
                <p>This website was planned, designed, and developed by yours truly. This is a <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/multisite/" target="_blank" dofollow="nofollow">Wordpress multi-site</a> containing an e-commerce site, blog, and of course the core site it self.</p>
                <p>The core idea of this venture was to offer small/medium sized businesses a custom built website they would rent off us for a small monthly fee.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://store.beyondvision.tv/" target="_blank">Meet bvtv.co.uk</a></h4>
                <p>BVTV was a great idea! Create online tv shows in our in-house studio with independent talent, the TV show itself was a 50/50 partnership with us and the talent. We would also create corporate videos and place them in the online tv shows as adverts.</p>
                <p>The website I built was a multi vendor e-commerce site where people can sign up, the site would create a branded site within the site where people can sell merchandise.</p>
